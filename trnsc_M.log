You said that you love winning.
And you have one in a lot in life.
In real estate, in business, in TV, in politics.
So let me start with my...
Mindset as I called you question.
We'll drive you more.
To look.
Maybe equally, or maybe both.
I don't like losing, and I do like winning.
I've never thought of it as to which is more of a driving force.
You've been close with a lot of the greats in sport.
You think I'll take a words.
You have people like Michael Jordan.
I think he losing more than anybody.
So, what do you learn from those guys?
Well, they do have something different.
You know, the great champions have something very different.
It's like the sports champions.
You know, you have champions in other fields, but you see it more readily in sports.
You see it over a weekend, or you see it during a game.
Yeah.
And you see that certain people standout and they keep... They keep standing out.
But it's there for you.
It doesn't take a lifetime to find out that somebody was a winner or a loser.
And so the sports thing is very interesting, but...
You know, I play golf with different people, and you have, there's a different mindset.
Among champions, there's really a bird.
You have a very different mindset, there's a different... Different thought process.
You know, talent wise, sometimes you can't tell the difference in talent, but at the end of a weekend, they... Seem to win, and it's very interesting.
Like as an example, a tiger.
Tiger or Jack Nicholas, he was a phenomenal winner.
And he does have a different way about.
Jordan, and there's never one here with.
One way Arnold Palmer was the nicest guy you'd ever meet.
And then you have some champions that aren't really nice.
They're just focused on... I'm doing the job, so you know, there's not one type of person.
But the one thing I would say that everybody seems to have in common is they're very driven.
They're driven like a bee.
They don't give upeasily, they don't give up, they don't.
But they do seem to be, you know, they- Maybe more than people that don't do as well.
You said that, Paul. 6th is a dirty game in the past.
It's a dirty game.
It's certainly true.
Uh, so if it is a game, how do you-
