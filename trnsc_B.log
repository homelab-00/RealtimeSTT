You said that you love winning.
And you have won a lot in life.
In real estate, in business, in TV, in politics.
So let me start with the mindset.
A psychology question.
What drives you more?
The love of winning or the hate of losing?
Maybe equally?
Maybe both?
I don't like losing and I do like winning.
I've never thought of it as to which is more of a driving force.
You've been close with a lot of the greats.
In sport.
You think about Tiger Woods...
Muhammad Ali...
You have people like Michael Jordan who I think hate losing more than anybody.
So, where do you run from those guys? Well, they have something different, you know, the great champions have something very different.
Like the sports champions, and, you know, you have champions in other fields.
But you see it more readily in sports.
You see it over a weekend or you see it during a game.
And you see that certain people stand out and they keep they keep standing out.
But it's there for you. It doesn't take a lifetime to find out that somebody was a winner or a loser.
And so the sports thing is very interesting but, you know, I play golf with different people and you have... there's a different mindset.
Among champions, there's really a very different mindset.
There's a different thought process.
You know, talent-wise, sometimes you can't tell the difference in talent, but at the end of a weekend they seem to win.
And it's very interesting...
Like as an example, Tiger or Jack Nicklaus, he was a phenomenal winner.
And he does have a different way about him.
Tiger has a different way about him. Michael Jordan.
And there's never one... you would think that there'd be one way Arnold Palmer was the nicest guy you'd ever meet.
And then you have some champions that aren't really nice.
They're just focused on doing their job.
So you have... there's not one type of person.
But the one thing I would say that everybody seems to have in common is they're very driven.
They're driven, like, beyond.
They don't seem to give up easily.
They don't give up, but they do seem to be, you know, they have a passion that's maybe more than people that don't do as well.
You've said them.
Politics is a dirty game.
No, it is a dirty game.
It's certainly true.
So if it is a game, how do you win at that game?
Well, you wouldn't if that came by getting the word out.
And...
